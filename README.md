Simple implementation of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) in PyTorch.

# CLIP
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) by OpenAI is an advanced model that unifies text and image understanding through a contrastive learning approach. It employs two neural networks, one for image processing and another for text processing, which are jointly trained on a large dataset of images and their corresponding textual descriptions. This training enables the model to understand and link visual content with natural language. CLIP's distinctive feature is its zero-shot learning capability, allowing it to generalize across various visual tasks without task-specific training, solely based on textual prompts. This makes it highly adaptable for diverse applications in AI, from image classification to complex visual reasoning tasks.
